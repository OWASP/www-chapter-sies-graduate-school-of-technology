## Welcome
Welcome to the official page of SIES Graduate School of Technology's student chapter of OWASP! Founded in August 2025, our chapter is dedicated to helping students explore, learn, and grow in the exciting world of cybersecurity. Whether you’re a total beginner or already a tech enthusiast, there’s a place for you here. Our mission is simple: **make learning security fun, interactive, and impactful.**

## Participation
All events hosted by OWASP SIES GST are open to everyone—students, faculty, and anyone curious about cybersecurity. Get involved in our **CTF competitions, technical workshops, projects, and other hands-on activities** that will sharpen your skills, boost your confidence, and connect you with like-minded peers. No prior experience is required; all that matters is your curiosity and willingness to learn.
